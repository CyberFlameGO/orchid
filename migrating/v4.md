# Migrating: 3.x -> 4.x
Changelog for updating from **3.x** to **4.x**.

## Changelog
### Additions
- Re-add back the option to use [`http`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/http.html) and make **undici** an optional feature.
- Added back streaming and a way to download files
- Add support for WebSockets, which can be used to stream data from a server to a client; this is completely optional and has it's own
API as of middleware and features. This can be used to receive from client A -> client B or vice versa.

- HEAD requests are now supported! It'll determine if the HEAD request was successful and redirect back to the original GET request.
- Parameters are now type-safe and ports are now checked for validity from a URL.
- **orchid** is now isomorphic with Node and can be used in the browser to enhance features.

### Updates
- Path Parameters are now type-safe :D
- Middleware API is now a bit more friendly to use and consistent.

## HttpClient updates
- The `HttpClient` now supports the `http` module and is the default backend. If you wish to use undici, use the `HttpClient.undici()` method to create a new instance of the `HttpClient` with unidici as it's main backend.

```js
// uses the `NodeHttpBackend` backend
const http = new HttpClient();

// uses the `UnidiciHttpBackend` backend
const http = HttpClient.undici();

// uses the `IsomorphicHttpBackend` backend
const http = HttpClient.isomorphic();
```
