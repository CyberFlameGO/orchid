# Migrating from v2
This is the migration guide for upgrading from v1 to v2 of Orchid.

# Changelog
## Additions
- Better Middleware API
- Serialization API
- Added `Response.body()` to use the Serialization API

## Fixes
- multipart/form-data Support

## Deprecated stuff
- `Response.successful` -> `Response.success`
- `Response.raw()` -> `Response.buffer()`
- `Response.isEmpty` -> `Response.empty`

# Serialization
Orchid allows you to serialize your own data without doing it yourself every time you make a request. Currently, this is only limited
to `Response.body()`.

An example on building a XML serializer would look like this:

```js
const { Serializer } = require('@augu/orchid');

module.exports = class XMLSerializer extends Serializer {
  constructor() {
    super(/application\/xhtml[+]xml/gi);
  }

  serialize(data) {
    const str = data.toString();
    return someXMLParser(str);
  }
}
```

Then we inject it into our http client or adding it with `orchid#method`

```js
// HttpClient
const client = new HttpClient({
  serializers: [new XMLSerializer()]
});

// Method function
orchid.get({
  serializers: [new XMLSerializer()]
});
```

# Better Middleware API
Orchid now has a new middleware API that is executed on different types. The old API would look like this:

```js
const { CycleType } = require('@augu/orchid');

module.exports = () => ({
  cycleType: CycleType.Execute,
  name: 'my:mid',
  intertwine() {
    // Now we do stuff here, we don't add the middleware since it does itself
  }
});
```

This is not an ideal API to use because it didn't support more than 1 type and naming conventions didn't make sense. The new API would look like this:

```js
const { MiddlewareType } = require('@augu/orchid');

module.exports = {
  type: [MiddlewareType.None],
  name: 'name',

  run(client, type) {
    // this => this middleware
    // client => The HttpClient used
    // type => The middleware type
  }
};
```
