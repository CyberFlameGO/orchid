## Changelog
### Additions
- Use `undici` for better performance
- Simpler middleware API
- Added path param support for requesting

### Removed
- All deprecated getters and methods from v2

## Simpler middleware API
v2's middleware API is hard to understand for beginners, so I made the middleware API more easier to feel more "express" like, which was in
my statement before but it didn't feel like it & type safety was just THROWN out of the window.

> One-type middleware

```ts
import { MiddlewareFunction, MiddlewareType, Middleware } from '@augu/orchid';

const mod: Middleware<MiddlewareFunction<MiddlewareType.Request>, {}> = {
  name: 'my.middleware',
  type: MiddlewareType.Request,
  init() {
    // init function when `client.use` is called
  },
  run(req, next) {
    // req => orchid.Request
    next();
  }
};
```

> Multiple type middleware

```ts
import { MultiMiddleware, MiddlewareType, MultiMiddlewareFunction } from '@augu/orchid';

const mod: MultiMiddleware<MultiMiddlewareFunction<MiddlewareType.Request | MiddlewareType.Response | MiddlewareType.Initialization>, {}> = {
  name: 'my.middleware',
  types: [
    MiddlewareType.Request,
    MiddlewareType.Response,
    MiddlewareType.Initialization
  ],

  onInit() {},

  onRequest(req, next) {
    // do stuff
    next();
  },

  onResponse(res, next) {
    // do stuff
    next();
  }
};
```
